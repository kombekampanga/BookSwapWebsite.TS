# BookSwapWebsite.TS ðŸ“š ðŸ”„
This is a website that lets you list books that you own, and swap them/ give them away to other people! It encourages everyone to share their love of reading without breaking the bank and not letting books go to waste! 

## Origin
This repository is my original book swap website from https://github.com/kombekampanga/BookSwapWebsite converted into typescript to get all the wonderful TS benefits - particularly type safety and autocompletion. This will be the main source code for book swap moving forward
